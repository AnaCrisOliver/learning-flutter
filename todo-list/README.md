# To-do List Project ✔️

This is my second Flutter project, a simple to-do list app inspired by [Andre Baltieri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OnQrqs17wI). It was an interesting project to make because it allowed me to practice my frontend skills.

## So, how it works? ⚙️
The app starts with a homepage containing a list of tasks. From there, you can mark a task as done or delete it by swapping the task box to the right or left. If you wanna add a new task than you can simply type the text you want on the "add new text" box and click the (+) button.
