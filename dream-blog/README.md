# _dream blog project 👩‍💻

This is my first Flutter project, a simple mobile app inspired by [Dreamlabs blog](https://dreamlabs.com.br/blog/). It was an interesting project to make because it allowed me to learn the basics of Dart programming language and its sintax.

## So, how it works? ⚙️
The app starts with a homepage containing [100 posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).To fill the posts with content I used [this JSON API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/), getting and placing the info in the homepage. The original post is composed by a title and a body, wich I decided to limit to 150 characters, so the homepage doesn't look polluted, but instead, easy and quickly to read. When you perform an action like taping one post it opens a new page with the full content. Yet, if you swipe to the right, you're going to see more info about the app.
